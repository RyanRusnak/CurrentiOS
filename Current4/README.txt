PowerBRIDGE iOS application

PowerBRIDGE was created using the iOS5 SDK and is a universal application. The iPhone and iPad storyboards are both included in the file so each can be adjusted independently, but the code and controllers can control both applications. 

Getting started:
Install xcode
open Current4.xcodeproj with xcode
Navigate to the appdelegate.m file
Ensure that the IP address is either set to localhost:3000/customers/2 or localhost is replaced with your computers public ip address
Click run

The application will easily run in the simulator. An apple developer account is required to run the application on the iPad or iPhone device.
